"""Argv floor for the two recursive-force ``rm`` catalog rules.

The catalog patterns ``rm -rf /.*`` and ``rm -rf ~.*`` match one spelling; a shell
runs the same wipe for ``rm -fr /``, ``rm -r -f /``, ``rm --recursive --force /`` and
``rm -rf $HOME``. This floor reads each ``rm`` command's own words: recursive and
force in any packing, order or long form, against the root or home ITSELF. A
descendant, a wrapper or an interpreter body is left to the regex and the sandbox.

Frames descend through unexpanded shell payloads (``bash -c``, ``$(...)``), kept as
written: ``\\x2f`` in shell source is text. Only an ``env -S`` or ``sed …e`` string is
also read printf-decoded. Words keep which characters were quoted, so ``'~'``,
``'$HOME'`` and ``'/*'`` are literal; comments, heredoc bodies and redirections are no
operands. A body only a data consumer receives (``echo bash -c '...'``), or a
substitution in single quotes, a comment, a quoted heredoc or after ``\\$`` in an
unquoted one, prints rather than runs.
